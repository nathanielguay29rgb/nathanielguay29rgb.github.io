<h1>Fish Tank Supplies</h1> 
<p>This page will outline the supplies that you need for your aquarium,
as well as some of the science behind why you need these things.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Tank (Holds fish/invertebrates, remember to do research on the capacity of your tank to know how many and which species to include)</li>
    <li>Sturdy Aquarium Stand (Supports the aquarium, make sure that it is rated for the weight of your aquarium and consider placing a leveling mat on top)
    <li>Filter: Sponge, hang on the back, or canister (Clears tank water and allows surface area for the beneficial bacteria in your ecosystem to grow)</li>
    <li>Heater (Heats water, do research to learn about the temperature ranges of your desired species)</li>
    <li>Lid (If your species are prone to jumping, get a custom lid or make one at home)</li>
    <li>Substrate: Gravel, sand, or aquasoil (Do research on the substrate that your species prefer, and think about aquasoil or root tabs if you are including live plants) </li>
    <li>Plants (Helps with water parameters and provided hiding spots for animals)
    <li>Thermometer (Confirms aquarium temperature)</li>
    <li>Airline tubing, air pump, and check valve (These add-ons are necessary if you are planning on using a sponge filter)</li>
    <li>Airstone (Quiets sponge filter and oxygenates water - optional)</li>
    <li>Test kit (Tests water)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cycling Process</h2>
<p>There are many cycling methods, but all of them have the same goal: Grow beneficial bacteria in order to convert ammonia to nitrite to nitrate (nitrogen cycle). This process typically takes 2 weeks to 2 months, and can be slowed down by an acidic/low PH. You can either use live fish or a bottled solution as your ammonia source, and can optionally use bottled bacteria to start a colony faster (although some bottled bacteria strains require specific water parameters).</p>
