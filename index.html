  <h2> People Who Are Important To Me</h2>
  <h3> My Family/Family Traditions</h3>
  My family is a <strong>huge</strong> part of my life. They are always there to support me, and I can always trust them. My family members are:
  <ul>
    <li>My identical twin brother</li>
    <li>My dad </li>
    <li>My mom</li>
  </ul>
  <h3> My Friends</h3>
  <p>My friends are so fun to be around, and I have known most of them for a very long time. My favorite thing to do with my friends is go bowling. When we go bowling, we always get arcade tokens to play air hockey. We also play some other arcade games.</p>
  <h2> My Interests</h2>
  <h3>Videogames</h3>
  My favorite videogames are Roblox and Geometry Dash.
  <h3> My Favorite Sports</h3>
  <p>My favorite sport is fencing, although I also enjoy running cross country. I really like playing sports because it is a good way to get exercise, and it can also be a way to spend time with friends if they play the same sport(s) as you.</p>

  <h2> Vacations</h2>
  <h3>Maine</h3>
  Every Summer, my family and I go to Maine to see my dad's side of the family.
  We also eat <strong>really</strong> good seafood. When we land at the Boston airport, our favorite restaurant is called Legal Seafoods. We always order clam chowder and lobster rolls, although my dad always makes lobster and steamers (boiled clams) later on in the trip and invites his parents (my grandparents).
  Sometimes, we also stay in Boston for a few days, and it is <strong>so</strong>
  interesting to see the Revolutionary War history and memorials.
  <h3>Hawaii</h3>
  Although we do not go to Hawaii as often as Maine, my family still loves traveling here.
  The island we always go to is Maui. Our favorite restaurants are called Monkeypod and Pita Paradise. Besides the food, we also love to swim in the ocean (the water is much warmer in Hawaii than in Maine).
  <h3>Thailand</h3>
  <p>During the winter of 2023, my family and I traveled to Thailand. It was such a unique experience, and the food was
    great. We saw so many cool temples and old architecture from the Khmer Empire, and also learned about Thailands involvement in historcal events such as WWll. We were even able to witness the religious depth of the country, because our tour group interacted with Buddhist monks at a monastery. </p>
