  <h2> Vacations</h2>
  <h3>Maine</h3>
  Every Summer, my family and I go to Maine to see my dad's side of the family.
  We also eat <strong>really</strong> good seafood and go to the beach.
  Sometimes, we also stay in Boston for a few day, and it is <strong>so</strong>
  interesting to see the Revolutionary War history and memorials.
  <h3>Hawaii</h3>
  Although we do not go to Hawaii as often as Maine, my family still loves traveling here.
  The island we always go to is Maui.
  <h3>Thailand</h3>
  <p>During the winter of 2023, me and my family traveled to Thailand. It was such a unique experience, and the food was
    great. </p>
