<h1>Fencing Strategy - Intro</h1>
<p>Fencing is such an interesting sport. To fence, you will need multiple pieces of equipment. There are 3 types of blades: Foil, Epee, and Saber. The most common blade is foil, which is the one that I use.</p>
<h2>Equipment</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Foil blade</li>
    <li>Fencing pants (optional)</li>
    <li>Jacket (Provides protection for upper body)</li>
    <li>Body chord and mask chord (Registers hits from the opposing fencer)</li>
    <li>Lame (Siver vest - main target area)</li>
    <li>Foil mask (Provides head protection, and has a silver bib at the bottom that is part of the target area.)</li>
    <li>Court/fencing shoes (You could use regular shoes, but these provide better support and grip - optional)</li>
    <li>Fencing socks (Often used in addition to fencing pants to provide protection - optional</li>
    <li>Under-arm protector (Provides additional support from torso hits - optional)</li>
    <li>Chest Protector (Provides additional support from chest hits - optional)</li>
    <li>Glove (Protects your dominant hand holding the blade)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Rules</h2>
At the beginning of a match, you must salute your opponent with your blade. In foil, you can gain right of way by moving forward or by hitting/beating the other person's blade. The person with priority will get the point if both people hit at the same time. You can also only hit with the tip of the blade on the lame, which is the silver vest that is worn on the jacket, and the bib, which is the bottom of the mask. There are multiple other rules, but these are the main ones that make the sport functional (for foil).
